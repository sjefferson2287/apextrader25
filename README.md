# OpOptions Trading Bot: Project Overview
Project Name:
OptionInsight 
Purpose:
The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based bot for analyzing, backtesting, and simulating options trading strategies. The bot leverages the Black-Scholes model, historical data, and customizable strategies to identify profitable opportunities and visualize performance.

Key Features:

*   **Option Chain Retrieval**
*   **Black-Scholes Model**
*   **Strategy Backtesting**
*   **Simulation and Visualization**


Target use will be JMI family Trust initially mostly for private consumption 
Core Functionalities (Completed):
Option Chain Retrieval: 
Retrieves option chain data using yfinance and consolidates call and put options into one DataFrame for ease of analysis.

Fetches option chain data using yfinance.
Consolidates call and put options into one DataFrame for ease of analysis.
Black-Scholes Pricing:


Computes theoretical prices for calls and puts.
Enables comparing market prices to theoretical values.
Option Greeks Calculation:


Calculates Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega for each option.
Facilitates sensitivity and risk analysis.
Mispricing Identification:


Flags potentially mispriced options where theoretical and market prices differ.
Highlights trading opportunities.
Profit/Loss Simulation:


Models P&L for single options and multi-leg strategies (e.g., covered calls, protective puts, iron condors).
Visualizes potential outcomes across a range of underlying prices.
Backtesting Framework:


Integrates historical data to simulate past performance of chosen strategies.
Currently tested with Covered Calls, Protective Puts, Iron Condors on multiple tickers (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, AMZN, SPY).
Computes key metrics like Max Profit, Max Loss, Average P&L, Win Rate.
Stress Testing:


Evaluates strategy robustness under extreme market conditions.
Assesses performance during large price swings or volatility spikes.
Data Export:


Saves processed data, theoretical prices, Greeks, mispricing flags, and backtest results to CSV for offline analysis.
(Suggestion:)
Consider adding a “Current Limitations” section (e.g., uses end-of-day data, no real-time feeds yet, certain assumptions in volatility modeling).

Current Workflow (Google Colab)
Code and analysis are in a Colab notebook.
Interactive environment facilitates quick experiments, plotting, and adjustments.
Strategies tested show promise, with Covered Calls and Protective Puts performing well historically; Iron Condors may need optimization.
(Suggestion:)
Note any version control currently used (if any), and where data output is stored.

Why Transition to VS Code
Clean Codebase: Easier to maintain and structure code across multiple files.
Scalability: Prepares for integration with other APIs, databases, or CI/CD pipelines.
Automation: Potential for scheduled runs, alerts, and continuous deployment.
Collaboration & Version Control: Streamlined use of Git/GitHub.
Deployment: Positions the project for deployment on AWS, Azure, or other platforms.
(Suggestion:)
Consider adding Dockerization or CI/CD pipelines later for a fully automated setup.

(Suggestion:)
Add docs/ directory for extended documentation if project expands.
Use logging module for better debugging and auditing.

Suggested Enhancements in VS Code
Feature Expansion:


Add more strategies (calendar spreads, straddles).
Implement optimization algorithms to find best strikes/premiums.
Streamlined I/O:


Use a config.json for default parameters.
Add CLI arguments to main.py for flexible runs (e.g., python main.py --ticker AAPL).
Interactive Dashboard:


Integrate Streamlit or Flask for a web-based UI.
Enable on-the-fly parameter adjustments and visualize updated results.
Real-Time Data Integration:


Incorporate APIs like Alpha Vantage, Interactive Brokers for live feeds.
Send alerts (email, Slack) for time-sensitive mispricing events.
Code Refactoring:


Add docstrings, type hints.
Enforce consistent styling (PEP 8) and use linters (flake8, black).
Performance Tracking & Data Persistence:


Store P&L and strategy metrics in SQLite or PostgreSQL.
Track historical vs. current performance trends over time.
(Suggestion:)
Integrate GitHub Actions or another CI tool for automated testing, linting, and deployment triggers.

Setup Instructions
Clone repository:

 git clone https://github.com/your-repo/OptionInsight.git
cd OptionInsight


Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

 python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run main script:

 python main.py


Run tests:

 pytest tests/


(Suggestion:)
Specify Python version (e.g., Python 3.9+) in the README and requirements.txt.

Roadmap
Week 1 (Transition & Cleanup):
Move code from Colab to /src modules.
Validate Black-Scholes, Greeks, and mispricing logic in VS Code environment.
Implement basic logging and error handling.
Set up unit tests for backtesting.py and black_scholes.py.
Week 2 (Feature Enhancements & Infrastructure):
Integrate HV vs. IV comparison and simple technical indicators (RSI, MACD).
Add a basic configuration file (config.json) for default parameters.
Begin implementing a CLI interface for main.py (e.g., --ticker, --strategy).
Week 3 (NLP & Advanced Analytics):
Add sentiment analysis (VADER) for market headlines.
Implement a simple data augmentation technique or feature selection metric.
Introduce a basic VaR calculation for risk assessment.
Week 4 (UI & Continuous Improvement):
Create a basic Streamlit dashboard to visualize P&L curves, mispricing flags, and sentiment indicators.
Integrate CI with GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting on every push.
Explore data persistence with SQLite for logging results over multiple runs.
Week 5+:
Real-time data integration, advanced strategies (calendar spreads, straddles).
Deployment on a cloud platform, set up alerts for real-time trading signals.
Continuous refinement based on performance metrics and user feedback.
